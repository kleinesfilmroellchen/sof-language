# Welcome to the SOF Programming Language documentation!

This documentation details the Stack with Objects and Functions programming language, an experimental stack-based reverse-polish-notation functional programming language created by kleines Filmröllchen.

- [Source code](https://github.com/kleinesfilmroellchen/sof-language)

While the README is comprehensive on basic concepts and a good starting point for interested people (like you), the docs shall provide the most thorough information on SOF, including a full language description/specification and a from-scratch tutorial (no programming knowledge required).

This documentation, like all of SOF, is a Work In Progress (WIP). As much as possible, non-implemented features are marked as such. It is licensed under [GNU FDL 1.3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3).

## Structure

The documentation is mainly split into three parts:

- The [Guide](Guide.md) provides a tutorial and a guide-like introduction to SOF. Read this if you want to start using the language or are just interested in a high-level explanation targeted at programmers.
- The [Library documentation](Standard-Library.md) provides API documentation for all modules in the standard library. Read this if you want to use standard library functionality.
- The [Reference](Reference.md) provides a specification for the SOF language. Read this if you’re interested in more details, or want to write an implementation.
